        <h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
        <!-- description -->
        <p>At least, not anymore...</p>

        <!-- title for next item -->
        <h3>Want bold text?</h3>
        <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
        <p>
            There's a wrong way and a <span style="font-weight:bold">right way.</span> Always use the right way!
        </p>
        <!-- title for next item -->
        <h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
        <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
        <p>
            <em>Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.</em>

        <h3>Separation of concerns</h3>
        <!-- description -->
        <p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!</p>

        <!-- title for next section -->
        <h2>Links</h2>
        <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
        <p>
            Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href="https://www.google.com">place</a> to place on the internet.

        <!-- title for next section -->
        <h2>Sections</h2>
        <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
         stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
        <p>
            Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
